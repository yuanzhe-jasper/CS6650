This file has some explaintion and illustration of this assignment.

The database used for this assignment is MySQL from AWS RDS. There is only one table called Albums. It has five properties. The following is the SQL used to create
this table. ImageData stands for the bytes of the image. ImageSize indicates the size of the image. It's 3475 bytes.

CREATE TABLE Albums (
	AlbumId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Artist VARCHAR(255),
    Title  VARCHAR(255),
    ReleaseYear VARCHAR(255),
    ImageSize VARCHAR(255),
    ImageData BLOB
);


In the part2. I added a new server and used the load balancer to distribute requests. The overall performance(throughput) increases 8%~20% after testing multiple times
In the part3, I added one more server to receive requests. The final results show that the increase(throughput) is around 13%


The results are recorded as screen shots and tables. They are stored in the screenshots directory.
